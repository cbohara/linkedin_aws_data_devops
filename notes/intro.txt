Amazon Web Services Essential Training

horizontal scaling
add more components/nodes to a system
ex: add more web servers to deal with increase traffic

veritcal scaling
resources added to single component/node
ex: increase CPUs for server

elasticity
autoscaling = supply always aligns with demand

design for failure
avoid single points of failure
decouple components as much as possible

security
customer responsible for security of application data
use HTTPS over SSL for data in transit
protect data at rest using encryption
all API requests sent over the public internet should be sent over HTTPS
rather than storing the secret key in code, app should be configured to pass value as input during the launch of the app

use IAM roles 
rotate keys often
create users and manage permissions

multiple availability zones (AZ) within a region
think of as multiple data centers physically isolated from one another and connected by a fast fiber networks

AMI
template for root volume
launch permissions
block device mapping to DB
design for failure by saving AMI for ease of restoring and cloning environments

Elastic load balancer (ELB)
balances network traffic across multiple EC2 instances for multiple AZ
single CNAME (some-elb-name.amazonaws.com) resolves to many ELB IP addresses, and can perform in multiple AZ
use ELB to distribute your system across multiple resources and AZ

use CloudWatch to monitor for failure
be aware memory usage is not natively supported with CloudWatch

EBS (elastic block storage)
persistent data storage attached to EC2 instance
alternative to temporary local storage

RDS (relational database service)
managed by AWS
high availablitity and fault tolerant

autoscaling
launch configuration - what resources to scale
autoscaling group - defines where to launch instances and limits
scaling policy - when and what conditions in which resources should be launched, based on cloudwatch alarms

storage options
EFS = file storage
files organized in directory hierarchy

EBS = block storage

S3/Glacier = object storage 
best for unstructured, non-relational data
object is any blob of data or files 
5TB limit per object
eventual consistency bc of replication across AZ

Elastic Beanstalk
fully managed FREE service for applications
only pay for the resources launched
write and deploy your code
then beanstalk automatically handles the details of provisioning needed capacity, load balancing, auto scaling, and application health monitoring
provides URL after setup, which can be typed into a web browser to access the running application

AWS OpsWorks
2 options
AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate
AWS OpsWorks Stacks - chef configuration recipes are run on the server

CloudFormation
allows for the definition of an entire application stack to exist as either a single or set of text based template files
use JSON to specify resources
parameters object can be defined in the template > declared parameters can be referenced as place holder values for the properties
actual values will be passed in at the time this template file is being used to create the new resources

CloudFormer
helps create cloudformation template from an existing stack

CodeDeloy
not a fully managed service
component service
coordinates code deployments to EC2 instances

what to deploy?
specific revision is specified for each deployment
revision = specific version of the application, including things like the source code files, or a compiled binary, and all other needed assets
revisions can be stored in GitHub, or in an AWS S3bucket

how to deploy?
deployment configuration is the specification that outlines exactly how a deployment should proceed to a defined deployment group
single configuration file specifically named "AppSpec" to specify how to deploy the application

where to deploy?
specifying the deployment group
a deployment group is an EC2 instance, or set of instances, to which the application should be deployed

SNS
publish-subscribe
publish message via email/text to multiple subscribers 
ex: CloudWatch alarm is triggered > publish message to SNS > send email to support team of production issue

SQS
consumers poll for messages from the queue

SNS + SQS
can use SNS with SQS to distribute workload in parallel across multiple components 
ex: upload image > send message topic to SNS > send message to 2 different SQS - one for converting image to PNG and the other to PNG

DynamoDB
noSQL norelational schemaless 
data stored on solid-state drives across multiple AZ
effective for creating stateless servers

Elasticache
adding in-memory caching layer between application and DB = great for performance
2 engine options
Memcached - stores data only as strings (up to 1MB), no persistence, easy to scale
Redis - can store larger strings as well as other data types (sets, sorted sets, lists, hashes), supports persistence

2 methodologies 
write-through pattern
first store in DB and then store in cache
pro - all data is stored in cache so will find what you need in the cache
con - more data stored in memory than needed
can use TTL to expire data over a period of time

lazy load 
attempt retrieve data in cache, if not found then find in DB and add value into cache 
pro - only needed data stored in cache
con - higher miss rate

AWS Cloudfront
CDN = content delivery network
CDN is a large network of distributed caching servers that help deliver content to end users in the most performant manner
store and cache an application's most popular static content at globally distributed edge locations around the world

use AWS CloudSearch if need a search engine for your app

API Gateway
fully managed
requests are made through the internet, come into the API gateway, and are then handled in a variety of ways
ex: gateway responds to that request by executing custom application code residing on an EC2 instance or in Lambda functions
can support multiple API versions running simultaneously
release stages can also be managed, such as alpha or beta releases, or development environments, such as test and QA environments

Lambda
configure 
- which function (handler) should respond to an event
- IAM role specifying the permissions given to the lambda function while running
- compute amount
- how long the function should run before timing out

event sources
microservices architecture using API Gateway = request comes to API Gateway > API invokes lambda function
s3 can be configured to invoke a lambda function when an object is added/updated/copied/deleted within a bucket
